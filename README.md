# Competetive-Hotel-Pricing

**Getting Started**
1. Find the hotels you're using, the name is just for human readbility. Ideally dont use commas because I don't know if csv escapes them.
2. Populate the hotels code box 
  - go to the tripadvisor for your page
  - after 'hotel review' there should be a code such as `g30155-d656024`
